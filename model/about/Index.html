        <h4 class="card-title"> Classical Waterfall Model</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Classical waterfall model is the basic software development life cycle model. It is very simple but idealistic. Earlier this model was very popular but nowadays it is not used. But it is very important because all the other software development life cycle models are based on the classical waterfall model.
Classical waterfall model divides the life cycle into a set of phases. This model considers that one phase can be started after completion of the previous phase. That is the output of one phase will be the input to the next phase. Thus the development process can be considered as a sequential flow in the waterfall. Here the phases do not overlap with each other. The different sequential phases of the classical waterfall model are shown in the below figure.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Spiral Model</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Spiral model is one of the most important Software Development Life Cycle models, which provides support for Risk Handling. In its diagrammatic representation, it looks like a spiral with many loops. The exact number of loops of the spiral is unknown and can vary from project to project. Each loop of the spiral is called a Phase of the software development process. The exact number of phases needed to develop the product can be varied by the project manager depending upon the project risks. As the project manager dynamically determines the number of phases, so the project manager has an important role to develop a product using spiral model.

The Radius of the spiral at any point represents the expenses(cost) of the project so far, and the angular dimension represents the progress made so far in the current phase.

Below diagram shows the different phases of the Spiral Model.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Agile Development Models</h4>
        <p class="card-text">In earlier days Iterative Waterfall model was very popular to complete a project. But nowadays developers face various problems while using it to develop a software. The main difficulties included handling change requests from customers during project development and the high cost and time required to incorporate these changes. To overcome these drawbacks of Waterfall model, in the mid-1990s the Agile Software Development model was proposed.

The Agile model was primarily designed to help a project to adapt to change requests quickly. So, the main aim of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. To accomplish this task agility is required. Agility is achieved by fitting the process to the project, removing activities that may not be essential for a specific project. Also, anything that is wastage of time and effort is avoided.

Iterative approach is taken and working software build is delivered after each iteration. Each build is incremental in terms of features; the final build holds all the features required by the customer..</p>

        <p class="card-text">The V-model is a type of SDLC model where process executes in a sequential manner in V-shape. It is also known as Verification and Validation model. It is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage. Development of each step directly associated with the testing phase. The next phase starts only after completion of the previous phase i.e. for each development activity, there is a testing activity corresponding to it..</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">RAD Model Models</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Rapid application development is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. A prototype is a working model that is functionally equivalent to a component of the product.

In the RAD model, the functional modules are developed in parallel as prototypes and are integrated to make the complete product for faster product delivery. Since there is no detailed preplanning, it makes it easier to incorporate the changes within the development process.

RAD projects follow iterative and incremental model and have small teams comprising of developers, domain experts, customer representatives and other IT resources working progressively on their component or prototype.

The most important aspect for this model to be successful is to make sure that the prototypes developed are reusable..</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Iterative Model</h4>
        <p class="card-text">In the Iterative model, iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a small set of the software requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the complete system is implemented and ready to be deployed.

An iterative life cycle model does not attempt to start with a full specification of requirements. Instead, development begins by specifying and implementing just part of the software, which is then reviewed to identify further requirements. This process is then repeated, producing a new version of the software at the end of each iteration of the model.Iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the full system is implemented. At each iteration, design modifications are made and new functional capabilities are added. The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental).</p>
